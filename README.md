# Python-Blockchain-SimpleEvoting
Voting System on Python uses SHA512 to generate HashKeys and Ency the Stored data in Nodes

# Advanced Data Structure assignment 
A voting system built on python using Simple Blockchain to secure the stored nodes using SHA512 encryption this will make sure the data is not really easy to gather ! 



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)


# Execution Method
Requires Python3 
```sh
$ python3 mainSuper.py
$ python mainSuper.py (if multiple Python versions are not installed)
```

# Output
Screenshot 1 - Shows Output with invalid age , valid age , Adding data .   
Screenshot 2 - Shows output with quiting and output of complete nodes and data .
